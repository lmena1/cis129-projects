print('There once was a boy name Jon who could tell the future. He could tell the future from his dreams. The only issue was that the future-telling dreams were indistinguishable from normal dreams and he has no idea which ones would come true. Last night he had a nightmare that he'd have a heart attack. The stress and anxiety from the nightmare sent him into cardiac arrest. ')
